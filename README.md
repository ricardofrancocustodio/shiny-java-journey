ORIENTED-OBJECT PROGRAMMING

   * Recursions are also one of the most powerful techniques to solve linked lists and binary tree-based problems because both linked lists and binary trees are recursive data structures. 
   
   * String questions, Array-based problems, linked list algorithms, binary tree algorithms, and dynamic programming-based coding problems are good candidates for Recursion in Java.

    * Constructor
        - Define how the Object must be initiated when it is created
        - A class can have 1 or more constructors, however they must have different signatures.

            > Signature of a constructor
                -

    * Overloaded Constructor
        - Two or more constructors in a Class with different signatures to define how the object state must be created


    * Abstract Class


    * Interface Class


    * Abstraction


    * Inheritance
        - Is a design technique to implement a IS-A relationship between objects
        - Implemented using 'extends' keyword (is an extension of Class/Object - 'BMW extends Car', Page extends Book)
        -

    * Polymorphism


    * Encapsulation


    * OOP Composition
        - Is a design technique to implement a HAS-A relationship between objects
        - Person has-a Id card, has-a SSN, has-a job, has-a car etc.
